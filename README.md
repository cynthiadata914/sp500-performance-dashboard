## Project Overview
As part of my data analyst portfolio, this Power BI dashboard visualizes how top-performing S&P 500 stocks performed over 6years period. It was built to demonstrate strong data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills, using historical price data to simulate portfolio trends and investment decisions.

## Tools used

- Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation.
- DAX for custom measures and calculations.
- Excel for the initial exploration and formatting.

## Key visualizations
